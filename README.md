Morn's part library
===================

This is a collection of my KiCad libraries for schematic symbols and footprints for whichever parts I need and use and my personal projects. They might also be helpful for you! I cannot assure you that these models are what you expect. They might contain errors. Please check your CAD models and designs thoroughly.

Conventions
-----------

* Parts are create with [KiPart](https://github.com/xesscorp/KiPart) and Makefiles. 
* When possible, footprints should be equal to the manufacturer's design specifications. In some cases pads might be enlarged to make hand soldering easier.
* See PARTS.md for information on included parts.
